# The C Programming Language

The **C programming language** was developed in **1972** by **Dennis Ritchie** at **Bell Laboratories** of **AT&T (American Telephone & Telegraph)**, located in the **U.S.A**.

## 🧠 About C Language

- **Developer:** Dennis Ritchie  
- **Organization:** AT&T Bell Laboratories  
- **Year of Development:** 1972  
- **Purpose:** To overcome the limitations of earlier programming languages such as **ALGOL**, **BCPL**, and **B**.

Dennis Ritchie is widely recognized as the **founder of the C language** and is often referred to as the **Father of Programming**.

## ⚙️ Characteristics of C

C has often been termed a **“pseudo high-level language”** or a **“middle-level language”** by many programmers.  
This is not due to any lack of power but rather because of its **ability to access low-level system functions** while still supporting **high-level programming constructs**.

- C was **specifically invented to implement UNIX**.  
- C instructions are **compiled into assembly code**, meaning:
  - Depending on the **complexity** of the program.
  - And the **compiler’s optimization capabilities**,  
  **C code can run almost as fast as assembly.**

## 🧩 Background and Evolution

- **Ken Thompson** created the **B language** in **1969**, derived from **Martin Richard’s BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language)**.  
- Using **assembly language** and **B**, he developed the **initial versions of the UNIX operating system**.  
- Later, **Dennis Ritchie** evolved B into **C**, providing greater power and efficiency, which eventually became the foundation of modern programming.
